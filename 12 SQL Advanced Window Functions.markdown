# Advanced SQL Window Functions for Data Analysts

Window functions in SQL are powerful tools for performing calculations across a set of rows related to the current row, without collapsing the result set like aggregations. Advanced window functions leverage **framing** (`ROWS BETWEEN`), enable complex calculations like cumulative sums, percentiles, and gap analysis, and require optimization for performance. This guide builds on basic window function knowledge, diving deeper into advanced use cases, practical applications, and performance considerations for data analysts.

---

## 1. Overview of Advanced Window Functions

### Concept
Window functions calculate results over a "window" of rows defined by the `OVER` clause, which includes:
- **PARTITION BY**: Groups rows into partitions.
- **ORDER BY**: Orders rows within the window.
- **ROWS BETWEEN**: Specifies a frame of rows relative to the current row (e.g., for running totals).

Advanced use cases involve precise framing, complex calculations (e.g., percentiles, cumulative sums), and performance optimization to handle large datasets efficiently.

### Why It’s Used in Data Analysis
- **Trend analysis**: Compute running totals, moving averages, or cumulative metrics (e.g., sales over time).
- **Ranking and segmentation**: Calculate percentiles or ranks within groups (e.g., top 10% of customers).
- **Gap and sequence analysis**: Identify missing data or breaks in sequences (e.g., gaps in order dates).
- **Reporting**: Enhance reports with dynamic metrics (e.g., contribution to group totals).
- **Data cleaning**: Detect anomalies or duplicates using relative comparisons.

### Real-Life Example
You’re a data analyst at an e-commerce company tasked with calculating cumulative sales by region, identifying the top 25% of customers by purchase amount, and detecting gaps in order sequences for inventory audits.

## 2. Framing Rows in Window Functions

### Concept
Framing defines a subset of rows within the window using `ROWS BETWEEN start AND end`. This controls which rows are included in calculations (e.g., for running totals or moving averages).

### Syntax
```sql
WINDOW_FUNCTION() OVER (
  [PARTITION BY column]
  [ORDER BY column]
  ROWS BETWEEN start AND end
)
```

- **Common Frames**:
  - `UNBOUNDED PRECEDING`: From the start of the partition.
  - `CURRENT ROW`: Up to the current row.
  - `n PRECEDING`: Previous n rows.
  - `UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING`: To the end of the partition.

### 2.1 Running Total
**Code Sample**:
```sql
SELECT order_date, total_amount,
       SUM(total_amount) OVER (
         ORDER BY order_date
         ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
       ) AS cumulative_sales
FROM orders;
```

**Explanation**:
- `SUM(total_amount)`: Aggregates `total_amount`.
- `ORDER BY order_date`: Orders rows chronologically.
- `ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW`: Includes all rows from the partition’s start to the current row.
- Calculates a running total of sales.

**Result** (example):
```
order_date  | total_amount | cumulative_sales
------------|--------------|-----------------
2024-01-01  | 100.50       | 100.50
2024-01-02  | 250.25       | 350.75
2024-01-03  | 75.00        | 425.75
```

**When to Use**:
- Track cumulative metrics (e.g., sales, user sign-ups).
- Analyze growth trends over time.

**Practical Tips**:
- Ensure `ORDER BY` matches the desired accumulation order.
- Use `PARTITION BY` for group-specific running totals:
  ```sql
  PARTITION BY region ORDER BY order_date
  ```

**Pitfalls**:
- **Default frame**: Without `ROWS BETWEEN`, aggregates may include all rows in the partition, not just preceding ones.
- **Performance**: Large windows increase computation; index `ORDER BY` columns.

---

### 2.2 Moving Average
**Code Sample**:
```sql
SELECT order_date, total_amount,
       AVG(total_amount) OVER (
         ORDER BY order_date
         ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
       ) AS three_day_avg
FROM orders;
```

**Explanation**:
- `AVG(total_amount)`: Computes the average.
- `ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW`: Includes the current row and the two previous rows.
- Calculates a 3-day moving average.

**Result** (example):
```
order_date  | total_amount | three_day_avg
------------|--------------|---------------
2024-01-01  | 100.50       | 100.50
2024-01-02  | 250.25       | 175.375
2024-01-03  | 75.00        | 141.916
```

**When to Use**:
- Smooth time-series data for trend analysis.
- Identify short-term patterns (e.g., weekly sales fluctuations).

**Practical Tips**:
- Adjust the frame size (e.g., 6 PRECEDING for a week).
- Use with `PARTITION BY` for group-specific averages.

**Pitfalls**:
- **Small windows**: Early rows may have fewer values (e.g., first row has no preceding rows).
- **NULLs**: Handle NULLs with `COALESCE` to avoid skewed averages.

---

## 3. Advanced Use Cases

### 3.1 Cumulative Sums
**Concept**: Calculate running totals across all rows or within groups, often used for financial or operational metrics.

**Code Sample**:
```sql
SELECT region, order_date, total_amount,
       SUM(total_amount) OVER (
         PARTITION BY region
         ORDER BY order_date
         ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
       ) AS regional_cumulative
FROM orders;
```

**Explanation**:
- `PARTITION BY region`: Groups by region.
- `SUM(total_amount)`: Accumulates `total_amount` within each region.
- Results show cumulative sales per region.

**Result** (example):
```
region | order_date  | total_amount | regional_cumulative
-------|-------------|--------------|-------------------
North  | 2024-01-01  | 100.50       | 100.50
North  | 2024-01-02  | 250.25       | 350.75
South  | 2024-01-01  | 75.00        | 75.00
```

**When to Use**:
- Monitor cumulative performance (e.g., regional sales).
- Compare group contributions over time.

**Practical Tips**:
- Combine with `WHERE` to limit the date range:
  ```sql
  WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01'
  ```
- Index `PARTITION BY` and `ORDER BY` columns for performance.

**Pitfalls**:
- **Large partitions**: Many partitions increase memory usage; limit partitions if possible.
- **Ties in ORDER BY**: Ensure deterministic ordering with additional columns (e.g., `order_date, order_id`).

---

### 3.2 Percentile Calculations
**Concept**: Use `PERCENTILE_CONT`, `PERCENTILE_DISC`, or `NTILE` to calculate percentiles or segment data into buckets.

**Code Sample (Percentile)**:
```sql
SELECT customer_id, total_purchases,
       PERCENTILE_CONT(0.75) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY total_purchases) OVER () AS p75_purchases
FROM customers;
```

**Explanation**:
- `PERCENTILE_CONT(0.75)`: Calculates the 75th percentile of `total_purchases` across all rows.
- `WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY total_purchases)`: Specifies the ordering for percentile calculation.

**Result** (example):
```
customer_id | total_purchases | p75_purchases
------------|----------------|---------------
101         | 1500.00        | 2000.00
102         | 800.00         | 2000.00
```

**Code Sample (NTILE)**:
```sql
SELECT customer_id, total_purchases,
       NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY total_purchases) AS purchase_quartile
FROM customers;
```

**Explanation**:
- `NTILE(4)`: Divides rows into four equal buckets based on `total_purchases`.
- Assigns quartile numbers (1 to 4).

**Result** (example):
```
customer_id | total_purchases | purchase_quartile
------------|----------------|------------------
101         | 800.00         | 1
102         | 1500.00        | 2
103         | 2000.00        | 3
104         | 2500.00        | 4
```

**When to Use**:
- Segment customers (e.g., top 25% by purchases).
- Identify outliers or benchmarks (e.g., 90th percentile response time).
- Support statistical analysis or forecasting.

**Practical Tips**:
- Use `PARTITION BY` for group-specific percentiles:
  ```sql
  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.75) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY total_purchases) OVER (PARTITION BY region)
  ```
- Check database support (`PERCENTILE_CONT` is PostgreSQL-specific; MySQL may require workarounds).

**Pitfalls**:
- **Limited support**: Not all databases support `PERCENTILE_CONT` (e.g., MySQL); use `NTILE` or approximate with `RANK`.
- **Performance**: Percentile calculations are resource-intensive; limit rows with `WHERE`.

---

### 3.3 Gap Analysis
**Concept**: Use `LAG` or `LEAD` to compare rows and identify gaps or missing sequences in data.

**Code Sample**:
```sql
SELECT order_id, order_date,
       order_date - LAG(order_date) OVER (ORDER BY order_date) AS date_gap
FROM orders;
```

**Explanation**:
- `LAG(order_date)`: Retrieves the previous row’s `order_date`.
- `order_date - LAG(order_date)`: Calculates the time difference between consecutive orders.
- Identifies gaps in order dates.

**Result** (example):
```
order_id | order_date  | date_gap
---------|-------------|---------
1        | 2024-01-01  | NULL
2        | 2024-01-03  | 2 days
3        | 2024-01-07  | 4 days
```

**When to Use**:
- Detect missing data (e.g., gaps in inventory logs).
- Analyze sequence continuity (e.g., missing invoice numbers).
- Identify delays or irregularities in processes.

**Practical Tips**:
- Use `PARTITION BY` for group-specific gaps:
  ```sql
  LAG(order_date) OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY order_date)
  ```
- Handle NULLs with `COALESCE`:
  ```sql
  COALESCE(order_date - LAG(order_date) OVER (...), INTERVAL '0 days')
  ```

**Pitfalls**:
- **NULL gaps**: First/last rows return NULL; account for them in analysis.
- **Ties**: Ensure `ORDER BY` is deterministic to avoid inconsistent gaps.

## 4. Optimizing Window Functions for Performance

### Concept
Window functions can be resource-intensive, especially on large datasets. Optimization involves reducing window sizes, indexing key columns, and simplifying calculations.

### 4.1 Indexing for Window Functions
**Code Sample**:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_region_date ON orders (region, order_date);
SELECT region, order_date, total_amount,
       SUM(total_amount) OVER (
         PARTITION BY region
         ORDER BY order_date
         ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
       ) AS cumulative_sales
FROM orders;
```

**Explanation**:
- Index on `(region, order_date)` supports `PARTITION BY region ORDER BY order_date`.
- Reduces disk I/O for sorting and partitioning.

**When to Use**:
- Optimize queries with `PARTITION BY` or `ORDER BY`.
- Speed up large datasets with frequent window function queries.

**Practical Tips**:
- Index columns in `PARTITION BY` and `ORDER BY`.
- Use composite indexes for multiple columns.
- Verify index usage with `EXPLAIN`.

**Pitfalls**:
- **Over-indexing**: Too many indexes slow `INSERT`/`UPDATE` operations.
- **Index maintenance**: Updates to indexed columns increase overhead.

---

### 4.2 Reducing Window Size
**Code Sample**:
```sql
SELECT order_date, total_amount,
       SUM(total_amount) OVER (
         ORDER BY order_date
         ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
       ) AS seven_day_sales
FROM orders
WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01';
```

**Explanation**:
- `WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01'`: Limits rows before window calculation.
- `ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW`: Uses a smaller frame for efficiency.

**When to Use**:
- Reduce rows with `WHERE` before applying window functions.
- Use smaller frames (e.g., `n PRECEDING`) for moving calculations.

**Practical Tips**:
- Filter early with `WHERE` or CTEs:
  ```sql
  WITH filtered_orders AS (
    SELECT order_date, total_amount
    FROM orders
    WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01'
  )
  SELECT order_date, total_amount,
         SUM(total_amount) OVER (...) AS cumulative_sales
  FROM filtered_orders;
  ```
- Avoid `UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING` unless necessary, as it includes all future rows.

**Pitfalls**:
- **Large partitions**: Many partitions increase memory usage; limit with `WHERE`.
- **Unnecessary frames**: Specifying frames when defaults suffice adds complexity.

---

### 4.3 Reusing Windows
**Code Sample**:
```sql
SELECT order_date, total_amount,
       SUM(total_amount) OVER w AS cumulative_sales,
       AVG(total_amount) OVER w AS avg_sales
FROM orders
WINDOW w AS (ORDER BY order_date ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW);
```

**Explanation**:
- `WINDOW w AS (...)`: Defines a reusable window specification.
- Reduces redundancy and improves readability.

**When to Use**:
- Apply multiple window functions with the same window definition.
- Simplify complex queries.

**Practical Tips**:
- Name windows clearly (e.g., `cumulative_window`).
- Combine with `PARTITION BY` for group-specific reuse.

**Pitfalls**:
- **Overuse**: Defining too many windows can confuse query logic.
- **Database support**: Not all databases support `WINDOW` (e.g., MySQL).

## 5. Real-World Use Cases

1. **Reporting**:
   - **Scenario**: Generate a report showing cumulative sales by region and a 7-day moving average.
   - **Query**:
     ```sql
     SELECT region, order_date, total_amount,
            SUM(total_amount) OVER (
              PARTITION BY region
              ORDER BY order_date
              ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
            ) AS cumulative_sales,
            AVG(total_amount) OVER (
              PARTITION BY region
              ORDER BY order_date
              ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
            ) AS seven_day_avg
     FROM orders
     WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01';
     ```
   - **Why**: Tracks regional performance and trends.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - **Scenario**: Identify gaps in order dates to detect missing data.
   - **Query**:
     ```sql
     SELECT order_id, order_date,
            order_date - LAG(order_date) OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY order_date) AS date_gap
     FROM orders
     WHERE date_gap > INTERVAL '1 day';
     ```
   - **Why**: Flags potential data entry issues.

3. **Joining Tables**:
   - **Scenario**: Rank customers by total purchases within their region.
   - **Query**:
     ```sql
     SELECT c.first_name, c.region, o.total_amount,
            DENSE_RANK() OVER (
              PARTITION BY c.region
              ORDER BY SUM(o.total_amount) DESC
            ) AS regional_rank
     FROM customers c
     INNER JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
     GROUP BY c.first_name, c.region, o.total_amount;
     ```
   - **Why**: Identifies top spenders for targeted marketing.

## 6. Advanced Tricks and Edge Cases

### 6.1 Conditional Window Functions
Apply logic within window functions:
```sql
SELECT order_date, total_amount,
       SUM(CASE WHEN total_amount > 500 THEN total_amount ELSE 0 END) OVER (
         ORDER BY order_date
         ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
       ) AS high_value_cumulative
FROM orders;
```
**Why**: Tracks cumulative sales for high-value orders only.

---

### 6.2 Percentile with Framing
Calculate percentiles over a rolling window:
```sql
SELECT order_date, total_amount,
       PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY total_amount) OVER (
         ORDER BY order_date
         ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
       ) AS median_seven_day
FROM orders;
```
**Why**: Analyzes median sales over a 7-day window.

---

### 6.3 Gap Analysis with Sequence Numbers
Detect missing IDs in sequences:
```sql
SELECT order_id,
       order_id - LAG(order_id) OVER (ORDER BY order_id) AS id_gap
FROM orders
WHERE order_id - LAG(order_id) OVER (ORDER BY order_id) > 1;
```
**Why**: Identifies missing order IDs for auditing.

---

### 6.4 Optimizing with Materialized CTEs
Materialize results to reduce window function overhead:
```sql
WITH filtered AS (
  SELECT order_date, total_amount
  FROM orders
  WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01'
)
SELECT order_date, total_amount,
       SUM(total_amount) OVER (
         ORDER BY order_date
         ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
       ) AS cumulative_sales
FROM filtered;
```
**Why**: Reduces rows before applying the window function.

---

## 7. Practice Exercises

1. **Cumulative Sum**:
   - Write a query to calculate cumulative `total_amount` by `region` in the `orders` table, ordered by `order_date`.

2. **Moving Average**:
   - Query the `orders` table to compute a 5-day moving average of `total_amount`, partitioned by `region`.

3. **Percentile Calculation**:
   - Calculate the 90th percentile of `total_purchases` in the `customers` table, partitioned by `region`.

4. **Gap Analysis**:
   - Identify gaps in `order_date` greater than 2 days in the `orders` table, partitioned by `customer_id`.

---
