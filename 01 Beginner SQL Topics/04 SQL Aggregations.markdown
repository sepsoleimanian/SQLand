# SQL Aggregations for Data Analysts

Aggregations in SQL are operations that process multiple rows of data to produce a single summary value, such as totals, averages, or counts. As a data analyst, mastering aggregations is critical for summarizing data, generating reports, and uncovering insights from large datasets. This guide covers SQL aggregation functions and the `GROUP BY` clause in depth, with practical examples, use cases, tips, and exercises tailored for real-world data analysis.

## 1. Understanding Aggregations

### Concept
Aggregations summarize data by applying functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, or `MAX` to a set of rows. These functions are often combined with the `GROUP BY` clause to organize data into subsets based on specific columns.

### Syntax
```sql
SELECT column_to_group_by, AGGREGATE_FUNCTION(column_to_aggregate)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_to_group_by;
```

- **Aggregate Functions**:
  - `COUNT`: Counts the number of rows or non-NULL values.
  - `SUM`: Adds up numeric values.
  - `AVG`: Calculates the average of numeric values.
  - `MIN`: Finds the smallest value.
  - `MAX`: Finds the largest value.
- **`GROUP BY`**: Groups rows with identical values in specified columns into summary rows.

### Why It’s Used in Data Analysis
- **Summarizing data**: Aggregations condense large datasets into meaningful metrics (e.g., total sales per region).
- **Reporting**: Generate key performance indicators (KPIs) like average order value or customer counts.
- **Trend analysis**: Identify patterns by grouping data over time or categories.
- **Data cleaning**: Detect outliers or anomalies (e.g., unusually high `MAX` values).

### Real-Life Example
You’re a data analyst at an e-commerce company tasked with calculating total sales by product category for a quarterly report.

## 2. Core Aggregate Functions with Examples

### 2.1 `COUNT`
**Purpose**: Counts rows or non-NULL values in a column.

**Code Sample**:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM orders;
```

**Explanation**:
- `COUNT(*)`: Counts all rows in the `orders` table.
- `AS total_orders`: Aliases the result for clarity.

**Result** (example):
```
total_orders
------------
1500
```

**Use Case**: Count the number of customers in each region.
```sql
SELECT region, COUNT(customer_id) AS customer_count
FROM customers
GROUP BY region;
```

**Result** (example):
```
region  | customer_count
--------|---------------
North   | 200
South   | 150
West    | 300
```

**Tip**: Use `COUNT(DISTINCT column)` to count unique values:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS unique_customers
FROM orders;
```

**Pitfall**: `COUNT(column)` ignores NULL values, while `COUNT(*)` counts all rows.

---

### 2.2 `SUM`
**Purpose**: Adds up numeric values in a column.

**Code Sample**:
```sql
SELECT SUM(total_amount) AS total_sales
FROM orders
WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01';
```

**Explanation**:
- `SUM(total_amount)`: Sums the `total_amount` column for orders in 2024.
- `WHERE`: Filters to include only relevant rows.

**Result** (example):
```
total_sales
-----------
125000.50
```

**Use Case**: Calculate total sales by product category.
```sql
SELECT p.category, SUM(o.total_amount) AS category_sales
FROM orders o
JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY p.category;
```

**Result** (example):
```
category    | category_sales
------------|---------------
Electronics | 75000.00
Clothing    | 30000.00
Books       | 20000.00
```

**Tip**: Ensure the column is numeric; `SUM` on non-numeric columns causes errors.
**Pitfall**: NULL values are ignored, which may skew results if not handled.

---

### 2.3 `AVG`
**Purpose**: Computes the average of numeric values.

**Code Sample**:
```sql
SELECT AVG(total_amount) AS avg_order_value
FROM orders;
```

**Explanation**:
- `AVG(total_amount)`: Calculates the average order amount.

**Result** (example):
```
avg_order_value
---------------
83.33
```

**Use Case**: Find the average order value by customer segment.
```sql
SELECT c.segment, AVG(o.total_amount) AS avg_order
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.segment;
```

**Result** (example):
```
segment     | avg_order
------------|----------
Premium     | 120.50
Standard    | 65.75
```

**Tip**: Round results for readability:
```sql
SELECT ROUND(AVG(total_amount), 2) AS avg_order_value
FROM orders;
```

**Pitfall**: NULL values are excluded, potentially affecting the average.

---

### 2.4 `MIN` and `MAX`
**Purpose**: Find the smallest (`MIN`) or largest (`MAX`) value in a column.

**Code Sample**:
```sql
SELECT MIN(order_date) AS first_order, MAX(order_date) AS last_order
FROM orders;
```

**Explanation**:
- `MIN(order_date)`: Finds the earliest order date.
- `MAX(order_date)`: Finds the latest order date.

**Result** (example):
```
first_order  | last_order
-------------|------------
2023-01-01   | 2025-04-20
```

**Use Case**: Identify the price range by product category.
```sql
SELECT category, MIN(price) AS min_price, MAX(price) AS max_price
FROM products
GROUP BY category;
```

**Result** (example):
```
category    | min_price | max_price
------------|-----------|----------
Electronics | 19.99     | 999.99
Clothing    | 9.99      | 199.99
```

**Tip**: Use with non-numeric columns (e.g., dates, strings) for chronological or alphabetical extremes.
**Pitfall**: Results may be misleading if the column contains outliers.

## 3. The `GROUP BY` Clause

### Concept
`GROUP BY` organizes rows into groups based on one or more columns, applying aggregate functions to each group.

### Why It’s Used
- **Categorization**: Summarize data by categories (e.g., sales by region).
- **Granular insights**: Break down metrics by time, location, or other attributes.
- **Data aggregation**: Essential for most reporting tasks.

### Code Sample
```sql
SELECT order_date, COUNT(*) AS daily_orders
FROM orders
GROUP BY order_date;
```

**Explanation**:
- `GROUP BY order_date`: Groups rows by unique `order_date` values.
- `COUNT(*)`: Counts orders for each date.

**Result** (example):
```
order_date  | daily_orders
------------|-------------
2024-01-01  | 50
2024-01-02  | 45
```

### Practical Tips
- List all non-aggregated columns in `GROUP BY` to avoid errors.
- Use with `ORDER BY` for sorted results:
  ```sql
  SELECT region, SUM(total_amount) AS total_sales
  FROM orders
  GROUP BY region
  ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
  ```
- Combine with `WHERE` to filter before grouping:
  ```sql
  SELECT region, COUNT(*) AS orders
  FROM orders
  WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01'
  GROUP BY region;
  ```

### Common Pitfalls
- **Missing `GROUP BY` columns**: All non-aggregated columns in `SELECT` must appear in `GROUP BY`.
- **Over-grouping**: Grouping by too many columns can fragment data, reducing insight.
- **NULL groups**: Rows with NULL values in the `GROUP BY` column form their own group.

## 4. Real-World Use Cases

1. **Reporting**:
   - **Scenario**: A manager needs a report of total sales and average order value by month.
   - **Query**:
     ```sql
     SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date) AS month, 
            SUM(total_amount) AS total_sales, 
            ROUND(AVG(total_amount), 2) AS avg_order
     FROM orders
     GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date)
     ORDER BY month;
     ```
   - **Why**: Summarizes sales performance over time.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - **Scenario**: Identify products with unusually high prices.
   - **Query**:
     ```sql
     SELECT category, MAX(price) AS max_price
     FROM products
     GROUP BY category
     HAVING MAX(price) > 1000;
     ```
   - **Why**: Flags potential data errors for review.

3. **Joining Tables**:
   - **Scenario**: Analyze customer purchase frequency by segment.
   - **Query**:
     ```sql
     SELECT c.segment, COUNT(o.order_id) AS order_count
     FROM customers c
     LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
     GROUP BY c.segment;
     ```
   - **Why**: Combines datasets to reveal behavioral patterns.

## 5. Advanced Tricks and Edge Cases

### 5.1 Using `HAVING` for Filtered Aggregations
**Purpose**: Filters groups based on aggregate results (like `WHERE` for `GROUP BY`).

**Code Sample**:
```sql
SELECT region, COUNT(*) AS order_count
FROM orders
GROUP BY region
HAVING COUNT(*) > 100;
```

**Explanation**:
- `HAVING COUNT(*) > 100`: Only includes regions with more than 100 orders.

**Tip**: Use `HAVING` after `GROUP BY`, not `WHERE`, for aggregate conditions.

---

### 5.2 Handling NULLs in Aggregations
Aggregate functions ignore NULL values, but you can handle them explicitly:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(COALESCE(email, 'missing')) AS total_emails
FROM customers;
```
**Explanation**: `COALESCE` replaces NULL with 'missing' to include all rows.

---

### 5.3 Aggregations Without `GROUP BY`
When no `GROUP BY` is used, the entire table is treated as one group:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_customers, AVG(total_purchases) AS avg_purchases
FROM customers;
```

**Pitfall**: Combining non-aggregated columns with aggregates without `GROUP BY` causes errors.

## 6. Practice Exercises

1. **Basic Aggregation**:
   - Write a query to calculate the total and average order amount from the `orders` table for orders placed in 2025.

2. **Grouping**:
   - Query the `products` table to find the number of products and the maximum price per category.

3. **Filtered Aggregations**:
   - From the `orders` table, list regions with more than 50 orders and total sales exceeding $10,000. Use `HAVING`.

4. **Complex Joins and Aggregations**:
   - Join the `customers` and `orders` tables to calculate the total number of orders and average order amount per customer segment for customers who placed orders in 2024.
